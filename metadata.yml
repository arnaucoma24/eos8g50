Title: FASTSOLV
Description: Prediction of organic solubility using deep learning on fixed Mordred-based
  representations. The authors test the models under rigorous solute extrapolation
  conditions, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating prediction accuracy
  near the intrinsic aleatoric limit of experimental data.
